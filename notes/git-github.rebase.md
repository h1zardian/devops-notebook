Rebasing is usually done in a brach to bundle up all smaller commits in a major commit that can be reviewed easily.
### Rebasing by pick & squash method

> use git log to get the commit-hash-value after which you intend to merge all other commits  
> `git log`
>
> `git rebase -i <hash-of-the-unaffected-commit>`
