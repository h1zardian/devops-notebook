# Learning, Retaining and Presenting methods

### 1. Retrospective Revision Table System

This system is a way of planning your study time by keeping track of what topics you have studied, when you have studied them, and how well you understand them at regular intervals over time.  
This helps you avoid forgetting what you have learned and consolidate your long-term memory.

Topics | First Day | First Week | Half-a-Month | One Month |
:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
A1 | 03 Dec21 üü® | 10 Dec21 üü´ |
A2 | 26  Jan22 üü©|

> **Tips** :  
> The main idea is to use your table as a guide and a feedback tool that helps you improve your learning and confidence.
>
> - Review your table at least once a week to see your progress until you hit level 3 or higher, then plan your next study sessions.
> - Review your table more frequently as you get closer to your exams to refresh your memory and focus on the most important topics.
> - Review your table after each study session to update your dates and ratings and celebrate your achievements.

### 2. Feynman Technique of Understanding a Concept

The Feynman Technique is a way of learning anything quickly by teaching it to yourself or someone else.

- Choose a topic that you want to learn more about and write it down on a piece of paper.
- Pretend that you are explaining this topic to a younger friend who doesn‚Äôt know anything about it. Use simple words and examples that they can understand. If you get stuck, go back to your book or notes and find out more information.
- Repeat this process until you can explain the topic clearly and confidently without looking at your sources. Try to make your explanation shorter and simpler each time.
- Use analogies or comparisons to help your friend relate the topic to something they already know. For example, if you are learning about atoms, you can compare them to tiny balls that make up everything.

> **Tips** :  
> When explaining the topic to someone, use the *ELI5* system of explaining things.  
> It involves simplifying complex or obscure concepts into easy-to-understand language. The idea is to make the explanation clear and accessible for anyone, regardless of their prior knowledge or background

### 3. Eisenhower Matrix for Tasks Prioritization

The Eisenhower matrix is a tool for prioritizing tasks you need to complete based on urgency and importance123. It helps you become more effective and productive in your work by helping you decide which tasks to do first, which to schedule for later, which to delegate, and which to eliminate12.

The Eisenhower matrix has four quadrants that you can use to categorize your tasks:

- Quadrant 1: Urgent and important. These are tasks that need your immediate attention and have a significant impact on your goals or outcomes. For example, a deadline for a project, a medical emergency, or a crisis situation. You should do these tasks as soon as possible.
- Quadrant 2: Not urgent but important. These are tasks that contribute to your long-term goals or vision but do not have a pressing deadline. For example, planning for the future, learning new skills, or building relationships. You should schedule these tasks for later and make time for them regularly.
- Quadrant 3: Urgent but not important. These are tasks that demand your attention but do not add much value to your goals or outcomes. For example, answering emails, phone calls, or meetings that are not relevant to your work. You should delegate these tasks to someone else who can handle them better or more efficiently.
- Quadrant 4: Not urgent and not important. These are tasks that neither require your immediate attention nor contribute to your long-term goals or vision. For example, browsing social media, watching TV shows, or playing games. You should eliminate these tasks from your list as they are distractions or time-wasters.

### 4. Cornell Method of Note Taking

The Cornell method is a way of taking notes that helps you organize and review your notes effectively. It involves dividing your notes into three sections: a right-hand column for notes, a left-hand column for cues or questions, and a bottom section for summary.

The steps for taking Cornell notes are:

- Write down your notes in the right-hand column. Use abbreviations and symbols to increase speed and accuracy. Try to capture the main ideas and facts from the lecture or reading material.
- Add cues or questions in the left-hand column. Revisit your notes within 24 hours and create guiding questions for your notes. These questions should help you recall the information and test your understanding.
- Summarize the note in the bottom section. Describe the content of the page in your own words. This should help you consolidate your learning and identify the key points.

> **Tips** :  
> You can use different strategies to review your notes, such as:
>
> - Covering up one column and reciting from memory what is on the other column.
> - Using flashcards or quizzes based on your cues or questions.
> - Comparing your notes with others or discussing them with a study group.

### 5. Zettelkasten method of linking ideas

The zettelkasten method is a system that optimizes our way of taking notes by focusing on linked ideas and knowledge management. It involves creating and storing notes on cards or slips (called zettels) in a box or a digital tool12. Each note should contain one idea or piece of information that is relevant to your research or study topic23. You should also add references, keywords, and links to other notes that are related or connected to the current note23.

The steps for taking zettelkasten notes are:

- Read and take smart notes. When working, write down your thoughts and the reason why you are taking particular notes. Use your own words and avoid copying verbatim from sources. Try to capture the essence and context of what you are reading or learning.
- Rewrite your notes for the zettelkasten. Once you have collected and summarized the information, it‚Äôs time to rewrite your notes in a clear and concise way that makes sense to you. Use headings, bullet points, diagrams, or other formats that help you organize your thoughts. Give each note a unique identifier (such as a number or a code) that allows you to find it easily later.
- Link your notes together. The most important part of the zettelkasten method is creating links between your notes that show how they relate to each other and form a network of knowledge. You can use keywords, tags, categories, references, or hyperlinks to connect your notes. You can also create index cards that list all the notes under a certain topic or theme.

## Framework of Using Cornell and Zettelkasten during a class

Here is how you can use the framework:

- Before class, you create a framework of reference by reading the textbook chapter on photosynthesis and reviewing your previous notes on plant biology. You also create an index card that lists all the notes under the topic of photosynthesis and give it an identifier such as P1.
- During class, you use the cornell method to take notes in the main points column. You write down your thoughts and the reason why you are taking particular notes. For example, you write ‚ÄúPhotosynthesis is the process by which plants make their own food using light energy‚Äù because it is the definition of photosynthesis. You also write ‚ÄúPhotosynthesis occurs in two stages: light reactions and dark reactions‚Äù because it is an important fact about photosynthesis. You use your own words and avoid copying verbatim from sources. You try to capture the essence and context of what you are learning.
- After class, you rewrite your notes for the zettelkasten in the cues column. You rewrite your notes in a clear and concise way that makes sense to you. For example, you write ‚ÄúP2: What is photosynthesis?‚Äù as a cue for your first note. You also write ‚ÄúP3: How does photosynthesis work?‚Äù as a cue for your second note. You use headings, bullet points, diagrams, or other formats that help you organize your thoughts. You give each note a unique identifier (such as P2 or P3) that allows you to find it easily later.
- Link your notes together by using keywords, tags, categories, references, or hyperlinks to connect your notes. Show how they relate to each other and form a network of knowledge. For example, you write ‚ÄúP1: Photosynthesis (see P2 and P3)‚Äù on your index card to link it to your other notes on photosynthesis. You also write ‚ÄúP2: What is photosynthesis? (see C1 for definition)‚Äù to link it to another note that contains more details on the definition of photosynthesis from another source (such as C1: Textbook Chapter 5).
- Review your notes regularly by following the links between your notes and exploring new connections or insights. Search for keywords or tags that help you find relevant notes for your current project or question. Create outlines or drafts based on your notes and expanding them with more details or examples.
